This is a simple program for SmartThings that allows you to set a level for which you would like your light(s) to illuminate upon the arrival of a mobile presence sensor/phone. 

My suggestion is to apply this to a little mode magic for an added touch to date night or keep from waking up the rest of the house if people are sleeping.
